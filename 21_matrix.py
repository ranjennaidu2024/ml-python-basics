# Matrix - a way to describe multi dimension list
# come a lot in machine learning - eg represent pixel
matrix = [
    [1,5,3],
    [2,4,6],
    [7,8,9]

# above is three dimensional array

# when want to access multidimensional array
# get first item of the array , the second item of that first array , like row column
